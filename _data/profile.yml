    Welcome to my homepage!
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a fourth-year undergraduate student and will receive my Bachelor’s degree in Information and Computing Science from the School of Mathematics, Jilin University in June 2026.
    In Fall 2026 I will begin my Ph.D. studies in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 
    supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~jfcai/" target="_blank">Jian-Feng CAI</a>. 
    During my undergraduate studies I conducted research under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://math.jlu.edu.cn/info/1061/14103.htm" target="_blank">Jiwei JIA</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests are Optimization, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Analysis, with a particular focus on the intersection of mathematics and AI.
    I am currently exploring <strong>machine learning approaches to discrete optimization problems, emphasizing theory and applications</strong>.
    If you are interested in these areas, please feel free to contact me.
